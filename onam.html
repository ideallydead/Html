            Onam (IPA: [oːɳɐm]) is an annual harvest and cultural festival celebrated mostly by the people of Kerala and is traditionally associated with the legend of the benevolent Asura King Mahabali, who once ruled Kerala, returning each year to visit his people. A major annual event for Keralites, it is the official festival of the state and includes a spectrum of cultural events. Although rooted in Hindu mythology, it is harmoniously celebrated by people of all communities in Kerala.

            Onam commemorates the return of the generous daitya king Mahabali after he was banished to the netherworld by Vamana (the fifth avatar of Hindu deity Vishnu). According to the Hindu legends, after Indra (the king of the devas) is defeated by Mahabali (the king of the asuras), the devas ultimately seek refuge in Vishnu, who agrees to restore Indra to power. To do so, Vishnu incarnates as a dwarf priest called Vamana. Mahabali (himself a devotee of Vishnu) conducts ritual prayers, one of which is attended by Vamana, who requests only three feet (steps) of land to build a fire-altar. Mahabali agrees, despite being told about Vamana's divine nature by the sage Shukra. Vamana grows in size, and in three strides, encompasses all of the universe and beyond. The three worlds are restored to Indra, and Mahabali and the asuras are banished to the netherworld (Patala). However, witnessing Mahabali's love for his subjects, Vamana grants the king's sole wish to visit his kingdom once every year. This homecoming of Mahabali is celebrated as Onam in Kerala every year.

            An alternate tale behind Onam relates to Parashurama, an incarnation of Vishnu who is credited in Hinduism with creating the Western Ghats and Kerala. According to this legend, Vishnu observed the kings of the Kshatriya (warrior) waging constant war on one another and growing arrogant. He assumed the avatar of Parashurama, the warrior sage, in the era of the king Kartavirya Arjuna. This king persecuted and oppressed the people, the sages, and the gods.[40] Following the murder of his father Jamadagni, Parashurama swore vengeance against the king and the warrior class, slaying them as he travelled the world. When all the oppressors had been vanquished, he threw his axe into the ocean. The ocean retreated from the region where the axe descended, creating the land of Kerala.[40] The Onam festival, according to this legend, celebrates Parashurama's creation of Kerala by marking those days as the new year.
