        I am an aspiring software developer currently pursuing higher studies in the country of India under the A.P.J
        Abdul Kalam University in the state of Kerla.
        I am 22 years of age and am a permanent resident in the district of Kozhikode in Kerala. The course I am
        currently studying is Master of Computer Applications under Government Engineering College situated in Thrissur.
        I am currently in the process of developing my coding skills and creating a skillset necessry to secure a good
        job in the IT industry.

        <ol>
            <li>
                <dt>Mathematical foundations for computing</dt>
                <dd>A theory subject detailing the mathematical foundations required for computing processes in a
                    computer.</dd>
            </li>
            <li>
                <dt>Advanced Data Structures</dt>
                <dd>A subject dealing with the various ways to organise data in a program</dd>
            <li>
                <dt>Software Engineering</dt>
                <dd>This is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and
                    maintenance of software applications</dd>
            </li>
            <li>
                <dt>Digital Fundamentals and Computer Architecture</dt>
                <dd>Digital Fundamentals deals with the fundamental concepts and technologies that underpin digital
                    systems, including how computers represent and process information using the binary (0s and 1s)
                    system, the building blocks of digital circuits like logic gates (AND, OR, NOT), and the creation of
                    more complex combinational and sequential circuits and memory devices. Computer Architecture focuses
                    on the design and interconnection of a computer system's core components—the control unit,
                    arithmetic logic unit (ALU), and memory—to manage data flow and execute programs efficiently and
                    reliably.</dd>
            </li>
            <li>
                <dt>Web Programming</dt>
                <dd>Web programming is the process of writing code using languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to
                    build and maintain dynamic, interactive websites and web applications that can be accessed through a
                    web browser.</dd>
            </li>
            <li>
                <dt>Python Programming</dt>
                <dd>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code
                    readability with the use of significant indentation.</dd>
